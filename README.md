final project for fundus machine learning for diagnosing stages of diabetic retinopathy

the dataset is a folder in the computer, download and extract : https://zenodo.org/records/4647952#.YGNjXVUzbIU

step by step instructions
1. download the fundus file
2. download the dataset at the link provided, extract the zip file
3. open the file, i prefer using cursor because it allows for easy debug using the ai tool if an issue occurs with the required libraries
4. make sure that in the first code box the path file to the dataset is correct
5. run the code, I am using Python 3.12.5 in a miniconda enviornment
6. in the last code box, specify the file path to the fundus imagery you wish to test and the model will output a prediction for the classification of diabetic retinoapthy
